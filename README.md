## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  
- (Optional) Git for version control  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thomascodex847/sleekbloghaven-48968.git
   cd sleekbloghaven-48968

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

### Development

Run the dev server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This should spin up a local development server (typically at `http://localhost:3000` or similar) with live reload.

### Build & Deployment

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Then, you can deploy the output in the `dist/` folder to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).

> Note: When originally deployed via Lovable, the repo would sync updates automatically. ([GitHub][1])
> If you want to use a custom domain or more control over deployment, consider services like Netlify. ([GitHub][1])

├── src/
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components (via shadcn-ui)
│   ├── pages/             # Page-level components or routes
│   ├── styles/            # Global CSS, Tailwind config references
│   ├── App.tsx            # Root component
│   └── main.tsx           # Entry point
